Name change is done via Deed Poll in Ireland.
[Citizens information](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html)
provides quite good documentation on the process.

There is no requirement to enrol the deed poll in the Central Office of the
High Court as, generally, it has no greater effect than a deed poll which
has not been enrolled. However, some organisations, such as the National
Driving Licence Service (NDLS), will only accept a deed poll which has been
enrolled. If you are applying for a gender recognition certificate and you
wish to use a deed poll to change your name, your deed poll must be enrolled.

WARNING: enrolling a deed poll makes it publicly visible, see
[Courts Service website](http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/075D7770C94358068025804B005C294B?opendocument&l=en)

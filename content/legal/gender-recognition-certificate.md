## For non-Irish citizens

Those born outside the State but ordinarily resident in the State can also
apply. Evidence of their birth is required.

[Ordinarily resident](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/tax-residence/how-to-know-if-you-are-ordinarily-resident-for-tax-purposes.aspx):
If you have been resident in Ireland for three consecutive tax years, you
become ordinarily resident from the beginning of the fourth tax year.
